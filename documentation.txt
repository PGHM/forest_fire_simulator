Background:

Wildfires are affected by the weather, the fuel type and the intensity of the
fuel available. Weather factors are humidity, temperature and wind speed.
Wind speed directs the heat and the flames and also brings oxygen to the
flames. Lower humidity makes the fuel more dry and makes it possible to the
wildfire to start. Higher temperatures make the wildfire burn faster. Fuel
types are different kind of trees, bushes and grasses. Fuel intensity
describes how much of the fuel is available in the area.

There are different kind of fires also. Groundfire, surface fire and crown
fire. Crown fire requires dense branches and that is why surface fire is the
usual way the fire starts and goes on. Although the fire can move much more
quickly in a crown fire. Crown fire also causes spot fires, which means that
burning material is launched by the hot air to another location and it will
start a new spot fire. In this simulation these different fires are not taken
in to account, because it could make the simulation too complicated.

As for fuel types, broad leaved trees are the least susceptible to ignite and
burn fast. Spruces are the most susceptible, because they have dense branching
and thin needletype leaves, that can burn very quickly. Pines are not as
densely branched as spruces, but have the same type of needles as spruces, to
they are still pretty flammable. Broad leaved trees also don't get that much
dead or dry branches as the conifer trees do. For the ground materials, normal
grass is not very susceptible to fire, but will burn if the intensity of the
fire is high enough. Tall hay grass will burn quickly though. There is also
much dead and old material from trees in the ground, more so in clear cutting
sites, where fire can continue even if there is no trees. Swamps have really
low rick of fire, naturally. Peat lands burn with smaller intensity than
mineral lands, although if peat has been trenched it can dry and burn pretty
easily. [1]

Another thing that also affects the spread of the fire is slope, as in steep
slope the heat and gases rise up and affect the new material that is about to
start burning faster. Similarly downhill the spread is lower, and the wind
usually blows uphill too during the day, although in this simulation the
direction of the wind is static, because of the data available. [4]

Without spesific source, the finnish Wikipedia article mentions that wildfire
usually spreads about 3-8% of the wind speed. [2] Another source gives upper
limits to the wildfire speed at 10~ kilometers per hour or 3~ meters per
second. [3]

Assumptions for the simulation model:

Humidity data was not easily available, so it is very hard to take to account
in this analysis. We chose a month (07/2006) where there was almost no rain
(16mm) and relatively high mean temperature (16.5 celcius), so there should be
a good chance for wildfire.

The slope will either speed up or slow down the speed of the fire by 0-8%.
This value is not based on any source, because we could not find any, it just
seems reasonable, it could really be much higher.

The wind speed differs at each elevation. We have wind speeds for 50m, 100m
and 200m so we will interpolate linearly the rest of the values for each
elevation from these base values.

The effect of the wind speed on the speed of the wildfire was pretty difficult
to verify, as we two very different kind of sources. With our wind speeds (3-7
m/s) the first source [2] would put the speed at 3-8% of that so the speed
would be around 0.1-0.5 m/s which is vastly slower than the 3 m/s from the
other source. We will adjust the reading from source one by doubling it
because of this and the final rate will be 8-16% so on average the wildfire
will spread at 11% of the wind speed if the wind is blowing directly to that
direction.

The direction of the wind affects how much the wind speed boosts the spread of
the fire. The assumption is that the wildfire speads to the direction of the
wind in a pear shape form [5], and the target is to adjust the wind direction
in the simulation model so that in a homogenous dense forest the simulation
would produce a result like this. Then we can apply it to a heterogenous real
world situation with different types of slopes and forest types.

After testing with the homogenous forest we arrived at following values to the
effect of the wind direction to the speed of the fire:

45 degrees: 60%
90 degrees: 35%
145 degrees: 25%
180 degrees: 15%

So if the direction is 45 degrees from the direction of the wind, the actual
effect of the wind speed is 60% from the original.

Lindberg et al has quite nice classes for all the mineral land forest types,
so we will use their relative fire risks as a baseline for the fire advance
rate and reduce the flammability of the similar type of forest in peat lands
by 25% due to the harsher ground level environment for them. 

Fields burn really fast, faster then any mineral land forest as they are
really thin and airy materials. Swamps, roads, water areas do not burn at all.
Old clear cutting areas have moderate burning chance, about the same as peat
forest on average. Seeding stand areas have small burning risk because most of
the fuel material is living, but there can be remnants of the felling which
can ignite easily. 

All the forest types also have higher burning capabilities the more they have
trees in the area (applicable for types which have information about the
amount of trees).

Pine dominated mineral soil forests (type 78) had the most average chances of
burning according to Lindberg et al so we will use them as a baseline that
will burn at 100% rate of what the wind speed, wind direction and slope would
indicate. Other types have their values adjusted by the previously shown
reasons.

The simulation model:

The simulation starts with one pixel burning and the wind speed set to certain
direction. The time starts from zero and is incremented by one second at each
round of the main loop of the simulation. 

In every loop, first we check if the fire will reach any of the pixels at this
second. If it does, we will set these pixels as burning and check if their
neighbours have any pixels that are eligible to be set on fire. If there is we
go through them and calculate the time that is required from the fire to reach
that pixel. Then we check if this time is smaller than the time from some
possible other pixel and update the time accordingly.

The time that it takes the fire to reach the next pixel is calculated by
taking the slope, wind speed, wind direction and forest type in to account to
calculate the speed of the fire in the direction of the pixel and
then dividing the cell size in meters by this speed.

Results are drawn to a gif file that demonstrates the state of the forest
every 500 seconds, burning pixels are representated with red colour and other
colours are as in the source forest type file.
